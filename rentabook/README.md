In this project, I created a web application that allows book lovers to lend and borrow books from individuals.
- A Borrower can search for books, view book details and contact Lender via an integrated chat app.
- A Lender can add/remove books, change book availability and message Borrowers.

This project implements websockets for chat via a library called Django-private-chat. Details can be found at https://github.com/Bearle/django-private-chat.
